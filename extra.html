                <p>My love to help people led me to serve as a volunteer at a health camp which was help for 3 days. I was designated as a coordinator and my job was to arrange various items and do the documentation part. Also, I completed my 60hrs of service at the NGO which included helping the aged and differently abled people. Spending time at this NGO not only helped me in my personal growth but also helped me in managing day to day tasks.</p>
